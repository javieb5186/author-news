After airing his grievances and frustrations at the end of last season, the wide receiver wanted to make sure everyone knew his words and actions were motivated by his love for the game and the team. \n\nOn the first day of camp, Diggs had the opportunity to explain himself and clarify his position to the media. He reiterated that despite the disagreement between him and the team, nothing had any lasting negative effect on his relationship with the staff and players. He described the situation as 'water under the bridge.' \n\nThe Buffalo Bills have high hopes for the 2022 season. After a successful draft, they added several talented rookies to an already dynamic team. Adding their star receiver in a more positive environment will only help their chances to succeed in the upcoming campaign. With Diggs feeling more motivated and excited than ever, the team is eager to see what he can bring to the table. \n\nUltimately, this minicamp tiff between Diggs and the Bills has been put in the past. Although he was never one to hold back his true feelings, the wide receiver's ability to find resolution before the opening of training camp sends a positive message about his commitment to the team and the game of football."
